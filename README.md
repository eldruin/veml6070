# Rust VEML6070 UVA Light Sensor Driver [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/veml6070.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/veml6070) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/veml6070/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/veml6070)

This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the VEML6070 UVA light sensor,
based on the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.

This driver allows you to:
- This driver allows you to:
- Enable/disable the sensor
- Read the UVA measurement
- Set the integration time
- Enable/disable ACK signal
- Set ACK threshold value

## The device
VEML6070 is an advanced ultraviolet (UV) light sensor with I2C protocol
interface and designed by the CMOS process.
It is easily operated via a simple I2C command. The active acknowledge
(ACK) feature with threshold windows setting allows the UV sensor to
send out a UVI alert message. Under a strong solar UVI condition, the
smart ACK signal can be easily implemented by the software programming.
VEML6070 incorporates a photodiode, amplifiers, and analog / digital
circuits into a single chip. VEML6070's adoption of Filtron TM UV
technology provides the best spectral sensitivity to cover UV spectrum
sensing. It has an excellent temperature compensation and a robust refresh
rate setting that does not use an external RC low pass filter.
VEML6070 has linear sensitivity to solar UV light and is easily adjusted
by an external resistor.
Software shutdown mode is provided, which reduces power consumption to
be less than 1 Î¼A. VEML6070's operating voltage ranges from 2.7 V to 5.5 V.
